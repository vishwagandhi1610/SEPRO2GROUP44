<h2 id = "overview"> About WolfCare ðŸ¤˜ </h2>

With the help of an online portal, WolfCare controls the patient's health portfolio while also offering doctor support. The drawbacks of manually scheduling an appointment with a doctor are overcome by a virtual system for scheduling appointments. It is practical, improves resource management, and facilitates calendar synchronization. This project offers a platform that enables users to register, look for doctors nearby, browse their profiles, and schedule appointments. Additionally, users can evaluate the findings of a medical condition and add test report values to the symptoms check, which we have added.

The new features, that we added are an admin panel which gives us the ability to see all the doctors who are available in our database. It lets us see the appointments between the patients and doctors and add/delete/update the symtoms of diseases. We also added a doctor panel which gives us the abilty to video call other patients and do an online video consultation. We also developed a user patient panel which allows us to book appointment with any respective doctor.
